# Spoil-nt
The desktop application Spoil’nt aims to decrease food waste by creating a platform for markets to offer items with close expiration dates to their customers for free. The application will work as a system to limit ‘purchases’ per day for each user to prevent any misuse of obtaining a surplus of items. The application will accomplish this by assigning an ID to each one of its customer users. Each customer will only be able to add a certain quantity of food offered on the application per day to their online baskets.
The customers will be able to obtain these items by going to the market in person and having their IDs checked by the market through the application.
